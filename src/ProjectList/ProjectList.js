            As part of a capstone project, Myself and 3 other invdivudals paired together and worked in an agile based work environment, working within 2 weeks sprints and collecting feedback from our Professor. In this Project we created a Starbucks clone that allows users to create custom Starbucks drinks that they normally would not be able to within the regular Starbucks app. The front-end is hosted by Github pages while the back-end is hosted by Heroku.

          This website will not only show my full analysis of NYC open data, but also demonstrated the utilization of python's libaries, such as pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. My objective was to research the Demographic of nyc schools and discover if there is a correlation between race/poverty levels in schools. I wanted to know if we see any trends between schools with a high number of POC students and poverty levels, and vice versa. Another issue I wanted to see was, do we see any trends between the graduation rates and racial background? I essentially want to see if there are patterns between oneâ€™s background and their school.

            On my journey to learning the React Framework, I created a Facial Recognition App with a sign-in/Register page to grow as a Front-end Developer. I explored many node modeles including particles and learned the css framework: Tachyons.
